First post on this blog. I'll be using this space to share:

- Security tools I build
- Analysis of interesting security problems
- Data-driven observations
- Technical experiments and results
- Random thoughts about security issues I encounter

Expect mostly technical content with occasional diversions into other topics that catch my interest.

My next post will challenge the fundamental logic of vulnerability scanning and present a new paradigm for modern security.
