## About Me
I'm a security engineer focused on building tools and analyzing interesting problems in cybersecurity. This blog is where I document my experiments, share tools I've built, and post my observations about security issues I encounter.

## Beyond Security
When I'm not diving into security stuff, you might find me:
* Training BJJ
* Reading philosophy
* Making music
* Thinking about random problems

## What I Write About
Most posts here will be about:
* Security tools I'm building
* Technical analysis and data findings
* Vulnerability research
* Random observations about security issues
* Sometimes, very occasionally, other stuff that interests me
